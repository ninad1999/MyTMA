MyTMA (My Time Managemnet Assistant)
Tells My Actions!

Inspiration
A lot of students like us face difficulties in managing time during thier hectic university schedules. 
They also don't have time to sit down and manage their calenders. In this decade of extreme depression and social pessimisism, we wanted to create soemthing for social good.


What it does
Thus, our application is a time management tool for students to create effcetive calenders and inculcate healthy habits 
and optimal time utilization for fitness/mental health/entertainment without losing the focus on their priority i.e. academics. 

How we built it
Setting up a cloud online for machine learning and text detection

Challenges we ran into
Accessing the user location and finding relevant events using API.
Using a javascript calender API for adding or cancelling events in the calender format.
Using machine learning for object detection (text detection to be specific).
Integrating all parts using a convinient pipeline.
Adding features such as creating reminders and conducting weekly surveys.
