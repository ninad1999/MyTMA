MyTMA (My Time Managemnet Assistant)
Tells My Actions!

Inspiration
A lot of students like us face difficulties in managing time during their hectic university schedules. 
They also don't have time to sit down and manage their calenders. 
Depression caused due to ineffective time management skills, is making the students in this advanced developing generation weak.
88% of the college students want to increase their ability to manage time but could not even get some time out to sit with their calendar.
Mental health is the best solution for social good.
In this decade of extreme depression and social pessimisism, we wanted to create soemthing for social good.

What it does
Our application- MyTMA is a time management tool for students to create effcetive calenders, inculcate healthy habit and 
optimize time utilization for fitness/mental health/entertainment without losing the focus on their priority i.e. academics. 
It is a user friendly application with a lot of innovative features.
  In details:
  Accesses the user location and finding relevant events using (tm) API.
  Uses a javascript calender API for adding or cancelling events in the calender format.
  Uses machine learning for object detection (text detection to be specific).
  Integrates all parts using a convinient pipeline.
  Adds features such as creating reminders and conducting weekly surveys.
